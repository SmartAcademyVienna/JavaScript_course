# Variables

Variable is like a glass of water that you can put/take something into/from it and use it when you need it. So basically data can be stored in variables.

## How to declare a variable?

Before you can use a variable, your need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. In programming world they call it `variable declaration`.

You can declare and assign value at the same time

## Rules for naming variables

1. Variable name begin with a letter, dollar sign (\$), or underscore (\_). It must `NOT` begin with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign (\$), or an underscore (\_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use `keywords` or reserved words. for example `var`.
4. All variables are case sensitive. `Case-Sensitive` which mean that `firstname` is not equal to `firstName`.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use either `camel-case` or `snake-case`

Can you specify the valid variable names:
| Variable name | Is Valid |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| firstName | Yes |
| Var# | No |
| first_name | Yes |
| num1 | Yes |
|first name | No |
| first-name | No |
| 1number | No |
| \$result | Yes |

## Variable data types

JavaScript distinguishes between `numbers` `strings`, and `true` or `false` values known as `Booleans`, Functions, Arrays, Objects.

For now we will see only 3 major type which are `strings`,`numbers`,`boolean`.

```js
let variableNumber = 0.75;
let variableString = "I love JS!";
let variableBool1 = true;
let variableBool2 = false;
```

## Using quotes inside a string

Sometimes you will want to use a double or single quote mark within a string. and this will related to the internal string.

In ES6 there is a special string forming called the `back tick` which is used to set variables in between string without using `+` to concatenating stings
